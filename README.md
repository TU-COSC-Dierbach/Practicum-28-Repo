## PRACTICUM 128 -Circle, Square, Triangle Classes <br>

### WHAT TO DO<br>
- For the Circle, Square Triangle polymorphism example discussed in class and posted
  on Blackboard (under the Example Code folder in the lecture notes for Module 1),
  complete the example by providing the missing Triangle class by doing the following,<br>
  * implement the Triangle subclass assuming that assume that all triangles are equilaterial
    triangles (i.e., having equal length sides).
  * modify the main program so that the user can select from either a circle, square or
    triangle and have the area of the shape displayed.
